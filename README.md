# [K-MEANS CLUSTERING MODEL](https://github.com/PhamMinhThuan/K_Means_clustering)

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

* Use Advantureworks DW 2019 dataset, collecting customer feature from this dataset.
* Create a K-Means clustering model to define customer segments.


## DATA MINING

* Restore AdvantureWorksDW2019.bak file
* Run file SQL, create SQL view
* Use python connect SQL server and show SQL view table.

## DATA CLEANING
